•	  This project is all about taking a handwritten image of a mathematical equation and extracting the equation from it.</br>
•	  Here we extracted polynomial equations and finally tried to evaluate primary school children answer sheets.</br>
•	  Used Convolutional Neural Networks and Opencv.

# Uploaded one more readme file which contains steps to run codes.
